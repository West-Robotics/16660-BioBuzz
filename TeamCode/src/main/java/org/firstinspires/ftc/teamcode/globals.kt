 * ==== HOW THE ROBOT PULLS A BALL OUT OF A FLOWER — EDIT THIS ====
 *
 * Autonomous drives to FLOWER_APPROACH_CM of a flower, stops, and calls
 * this routine. Replace the body with the real mechanism sequence for the
 * final design (servo sweep, arm motion, winch, etc.). It runs ONCE per
 * flower stop, on the OpMode thread, so Thread.sleep / blocking waits are OK
 * in AUTONOMOUS (a phase loop that fully stops first).
 *
 * SelfPlay also calls it, but there it runs inside the live control loop: it
 * is latched to fire at most ONCE per flower approach, and while it runs the
 * deadman is not polled — so keep the routine SHORT (well under ~0.5 s), or
 * restructure it as a non-blocking state machine when the real mechanism
 * exists.
 *
 * The active OpMode passes in its own Intake/Loader instances (there are no
 * hardware singletons anymore — see the note in TestOpModes.kt).
 *
 * Default placeholder: reverse-pulse the intake (assumes pulling = backing
 * the ball out with the intake until a real mechanism exists).
