# BioBuzz computer tools (Python + OpenCV)

Two desktop tools that support the robot's vision and shooter calibration.
They run on any machine with Python 3 — your Mac is fine.

```bash
cd tools
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 1. `hsv_calibrator.py` — tune the ball/flower/robot color ranges

A GUI with HSV sliders, live mask preview, automatic bounding boxes, and
mouse-drawn bounding boxes. Run it on a video of the field or a live webcam:

```bash
python3 hsv_calibrator.py --camera 0                 # live webcam
python3 hsv_calibrator.py field_video.mp4            # a recorded video
python3 hsv_calibrator.py video.mp4 --name POLLEN_HSV_RANGE
```

- **Sliders** (H/S/V min & max) live in the "HSV Controls" window. OpenCV's hue
  runs **0–180 — the exact same scale the robot's Kotlin `ColorRange` uses**, so
  values transfer 1:1.
- **Bounding boxes**: the tool draws green/yellow boxes around everything the
  current range matches. To build a range from a sample instead, **drag a box
  around a ball** with the mouse, then press **`f`** — the sliders jump to the
  min/max HSV inside your box. Nudge from there.
- Press **`s`** to print a paste-ready `ColorRange(...)` snippet for `globals.kt`.
- Press **`p`** to save the range as a JSON preset (default `hsv_presets.json`) —
  the flywheel analyzer can reuse it.
- `SPACE` pause, `u` undo box, `q` quit.

## 2. `flywheel_analyzer.py` — automatic shooter calibration from video

Films of the calibration shots are analyzed automatically: it tracks the ball,
finds where each shot lands, converts pixels to cm, and prints the numbers
ready to paste into `globals.kt` (`SHOOTER_CALIBRATION_DISTANCE_CM`).

### Camera setup (do this once)

1. **Fix the camera** (tripod / propped phone). It must not move during filming.
2. Point it **roughly side-on** to the ball's flight path, so the ball's
   *lowest point in the frame* is where it touches the floor.
3. Put **two tape marks on the floor a known distance apart** (e.g. 100 cm),
   in view of the camera, roughly along the flight direction.
4. Tune the ball's HSV first with `hsv_calibrator.py` and save the preset
   (`p`), or plan to pass `--hsv` numbers.

### Robot + filming procedure

1. Run the **"Flywheel Calibration"** OpMode (group *Test* on the Driver
   Station). Pick a RPM step, press **A** to spin up, wait for `AT SPEED`,
   press **X** to feed one ball. Film each shot.
2. Film the shots **in order 6000 → 5000 → 4000 → 3000 → 2000 → 1000** (one
   video is easiest; one video per shot also works — run the analyzer once per
   video with a single `--rpm` value).

### Analyze

```bash
# one video with all six shots (default order 6000..1000):
python3 flywheel_analyzer.py calib.mp4

# ball color from a preset saved by hsv_calibrator.py:
python3 flywheel_analyzer.py calib.mp4 --preset hsv_presets.json --preset-name POLLEN_HSV_RANGE

# or pass the range inline (H_MIN S_MIN V_MIN H_MAX S_MAX V_MAX):
python3 flywheel_analyzer.py calib.mp4 --hsv 14 100 100 35 255 255

# one video per shot:
python3 flywheel_analyzer.py shot_6000.mp4 --rpm 6000
```

The first frame opens a **click-calibration** window:

- Click **1**: the launch point (where the ball exits the flywheel).
- Clicks **2 & 3**: your two tape marks (`--ref-cm 100` by default — change it
  if your marks are a different distance apart).
- `c` confirms, `u` undoes.

It then plays the annotated video while tracking (press `q` to fast-forward
without display) and prints:

- the measured landing distance per RPM,
- a paste-ready `SHOOTER_CALIBRATION_RPM` / `SHOOTER_CALIBRATION_DISTANCE_CM`
  block for `globals.kt` (sorted 6000 → 1000),
- a `*_calibration.json` next to the video with the raw results.

### Finish on the robot

Paste the printed distances into `globals.kt`. That's it — `ShooterModel`
immediately starts interpolating the curve, the shooting window widens to the
calibrated reach, and teleop/autonomous spin the flywheel to the RPM the live
hive distance needs (firing only once **both** wheels are at speed). While
idle the flywheel stays primed at `FLYWHEEL_PRIME_RPM` so spin-up is quick.

### Analyzer assumptions & knobs

- Side-on, static camera (landing = lowest tracked point).
- One ball visible at a time; other same-colored objects near the launcher can
  confuse tracking (move them away while calibrating).
- `--launch-radius` (default 120 px): how near the launch point a new shot
  must appear; raise it if shots aren't detected, lower it if tracks merge.
- `--lost-frames` (default 25): how long the ball can vanish before a track
  ends; raise for low frame-rate videos.
- `--min-area` (default 80 px²): noise floor for the ball blob.

## 3. `blackbox_builder.py` — turn recorded matches into datasets

Every OpMode on the `feature/superhuman-autonomy` branch records a full-match
Black Box session to the Robot Controller's storage (passive, onboard-only —
see `docs/LEGALITY-REVIEW.md`): state lines (pose, vision, planner decisions,
flywheel RPMs, battery, gamepad inputs), events, and subsampled JPEG frames
from BOTH robot cameras.

**Pull the data off the phone** over USB (MTP) from:
`Android/data/org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller/files/blackbox/<label>_<ts>/`

**Build the dataset** (pure standard library — no installs):

```bash
python3 blackbox_builder.py ../blackbox/teleop_1760000000000
python3 blackbox_builder.py SESSION_DIR --out my_match --copy-frames
```

Outputs `state.csv`, `events.csv`, `frames.csv`, `report.txt` (duration,
distance traveled, battery curve, flywheel peaks, planner decision histogram,
event timeline) and, with `--copy-frames`, sequential `UP_000000.jpg` /
`FRONT_000000.jpg` images synced to the log timestamps.

The shadow-mode planner records what the AI **would** have done each second
while the human drove — compare its decision histogram in `report.txt` against
what actually happened to quantify "is the AI better than us yet?"

## 4. Learning tools — the robot gets better between matches

These close the Black Box loop: matches record data, these tools turn it into
better constants, you paste the output back into `globals.kt`.

### `shooter_refit.py` — the shooter curve learns from every confirmed shot

Every `fire_start` → `shot_confirmed` pair with a live hive distance is a free
calibration sample. Buckets them by distance, averages the RPM that worked,
prints a refined `SHOOTER_CALIBRATION_*` block (any number of points), plus
success-per-RPM-band and battery-voltage-on-misses diagnostics:

```bash
python3 shooter_refit.py ../blackbox
python3 shooter_refit.py ../blackbox --bin-cm 15 --min-samples 3
```

### `planner_fit.py` — planner costs measured, not guessed

Measures real robot speed (from pose deltas), real collect cycles
(`COLLECT_BALL` decision → `ball_collected`), real score cycles, and loader
stroke→confirm timing, then prints suggested `ROBOT_SPEED_CM_PER_SEC`,
`PLANNER_COLLECT_HANDLE_SEC`, `PLANNER_SCORE_TOTAL_SEC`:

```bash
python3 planner_fit.py ../blackbox
```

### `hsv_autotune.py` — color ranges learned from confirmed pickups

Opens the FRONT frames nearest each confirmed `ball_collected` event, runs
your current HSV range, accumulates the ball blobs' real pixel values, and
proposes tightened saturation/value bounds (hue stays). Needs
`opencv-python`. Always sanity-check the proposal with `hsv_calibrator.py`
before pasting:

```bash
python3 hsv_autotune.py ../blackbox --hsv "14 100 100 35 255 255"
python3 hsv_autotune.py ../blackbox --label "Nectar Blue"
```

### The weekly loop

1. Play matches/practice (Black Box on).
2. `blackbox_builder.py` — review the report.
3. `shooter_refit.py` + `planner_fit.py` (+ `hsv_autotune.py` if colors drift).
4. Paste suggested constants into `globals.kt` (after eyeballing them).
5. Repeat — the robot gets sharper every session, and the data proves it.

## 5. Legality

Before using the Black Box frame capture or the SelfPlay OpMode in an
official match, read `docs/LEGALITY-REVIEW.md` (rule-by-rule analysis +
verification checklist). Kill switches: `BLACKBOX_ENABLED` and
`SHADOW_PLANNER_ENABLED` in `globals.kt`.

## 6. Neural nets (all on-robot: TFLite detector + pure-Kotlin shot predictor)

Staged plan: **B (shot predictor) first, then A (ball detector), C (imitation)
later**. Everything runs INSIDE the Robot Controller app on the robot — no
co-processor, no network, lowest latency. Trained models live in the app's
external storage (the same folder that contains `blackbox/`): make an `nn/`
folder there and drop in:

    nn/shot_predictor.json     tiny MLP weights — pure Kotlin runs it
    nn/ball_detector.tflite    tiny YOLO, float-I/O TFLite export

### Stage B — shot-outcome predictor

1. Play matches / run the calibration OpMode with the Black Box on.
2. `python3 train_shot_predictor.py ../blackbox`
   (needs >= 30 logged shots with live hive distances and MIXED outcomes;
   needs `numpy`)
3. Copy the printed JSON to `<app files>/nn/shot_predictor.json`.
4. Run the **Neural Net Test** OpMode — the P(hit) table should look like a
   sensible curve, high where the shooter is dialed in.
5. Keep `SHOT_PREDICTOR_MODE = ADVISORY` for a few matches (every prediction
   is logged as `nn_shot` records — review with blackbox_builder), then flip
   to `REFEREE` to let it nudge low-probability shots by at most +/- 5% RPM.

### Stage A — ball/flower detector (tiny YOLO)

1. `python3 auto_label.py ../blackbox --out dataset`
   The HSV pipeline acts as the teacher: every saved FRONT frame gets
   labeled; background frames are kept as negatives.
2. `python3 label_review.py dataset`
   Fix the ~5% the teacher got wrong: `a` = add-mode then drag to draw,
   click + `d` = delete, `c` = cycle class, `s` = save, `n`/`p` = navigate.
3. `pip install ultralytics` (LAPTOP only), then:
   `python3 train_detector.py dataset --model yolov8n.pt --imgsz 320`
   Any tiny ultralytics model works — use the newest nano your install has.
   Keep `--imgsz 320`: the Control Hub must run this in real time next to
   the rest of vision.
4. Copy the exported `.tflite` to `<app files>/nn/ball_detector.tflite`.
5. Bench-check with the **Neural Net Test** OpMode — detections draw cyan on
   the Driver Station preview. Authority ladder (`NN_DETECTOR_MODE`):
   **ADVISORY** (default: preview + logs only) -> **REFEREE** (removes HSV
   blobs the detector doesn't corroborate) -> **PRIMARY** (also adds
   detector-only finds as targets).

### Stage C — imitation policy (data collection already running)

Shadow-mode logs (planner decisions + full human inputs + outcomes) are the
training set. When there's a pile of sessions, the trainer gets built the
same way: auto-label from logs, train heavy on the laptop, deploy small.

### Performance notes

* `NN_DETECT_HZ = 3` on the Control Hub is a good start — the CPU also runs
  the HSV pipeline, AprilTags, and frame capture. Watch the preview FPS.
* The shot predictor costs microseconds (it's ~50 multiply-adds in Kotlin).
* Both nets log everything (`nn_shot`, `nn_det`, `nn_status` records), so
  ADVISORY mode doubles as the evaluation harness before flipping authority.
